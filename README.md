# ZenboJuniorProjects

Demos created to show how Zenbo Junior can support patients on their care pathways.

## Vitals and Health Readings Demo
Allows user to record their vitals data (temperature, blood pressure, blood sugar, etc) by showing the medical device to the robot. The user can also sign into their profile by showing their health card. Uses OCR with Google's ML Kit and Android's CameraX Library 

## Medication Demo 
Allows users to view all of their medications (not care pathway specific) and manually add a record of when they have taken their medications. 

Using Zenbo Junior's dialog ability, the robot can answer user questions such as "How often can I use my inhaler?", "How many pills do I take?", "How long do I need to take this medication", etc. The robot can also assist in adding a record of when the patient has taken their medication. If a calendar was implemented based off the medications' frequencies, the robot can also be used to remind users when to take their medications.

## Mental Health and COPD Demo 
Originally was meant to showcase Zenbo's ability to be a companion robot but evolved to include an escalation determination feature for COPD patients using Canada's COPD Action Plan. User's can report COPD symptoms and answer some follow up questions for the robot to determine what level they are at what actions they should take. User's can also say how they are feeling (happy, sad, confused, nervous) and the robot can help them

## Post Op Exercises Demo
Meant to remind patients about exercises they should to post surgery. Tracks which exercises they have done and guide patients through their exercises through videos.
